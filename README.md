# Coursera-Clean-and-analyze-social-media-usage-data-with-Python
For the project on Coursera website (https://www.coursera.org/learn/analyze-social-media-python/home/welcome), I'm taking a (supposed) role for a social media marketing company that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform, and help them to automatically extract tweets posted from one or more categories, and to clean, analyze and visualize the data. 

Projects objectives are:
1. Increase client reach and engagement
2. Gain valuable insights that will help improve social media performance
3. Achieve their social media goals and provide data-driven recommendations
